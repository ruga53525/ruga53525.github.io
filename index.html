<h2> <span style = "color:green"> Biography </span></h2>

<p> My name is Aanchal. And I came to this planet on the October 25th 2000. I come from a country called India, although I have lived in china from 8 years. I have ben to a total of 3 schools (all in china). The most present school is Hangzhou International School. In sports I enjoy volleyball and basketball. The most influential teachers in my school career yet are the Brunners ( Mr. and Mrs. Brunner). Because they always had a positive attitude class and they make learning very interesting and entertaining. Things I enjoy the most in school are learning about the geography of the world and writing essays. Challenges I overcome in 9th grade are cooping up with the class. The most I want to make out of this class is to learn how to make my own site and applications.
